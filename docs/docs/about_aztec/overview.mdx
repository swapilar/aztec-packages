Aztec is introduced as a Layer 2 solution bringing programmable privacy to Ethereum.

### **Private Smart Contracts on Aztec**

In Aztec, a smart contract is a collection of functions expressed as ZK-SNARK circuits. These circuits enable different modes of execution:

- **Secret Functions:** Reading and writing private state, reading historic public state, interacting with Ethereum (sending/receiving messages), and reading Ethereum state. They can invoke other secret or public functions.
- **Public Functions:** Reading and writing public state, writing private state, interacting with Ethereum, and reading Ethereum state. They can invoke other public functions.
- **Portal Contracts:** Contracts on Ethereum that receive messages from Aztec or send messages to Aztec from Ethereum contracts.

### **Privacy in Different Aspects: User, Data, and Code**

- **User Privacy:** Transactions don't reveal information about the sender or recipient.
- **Data Privacy:** Transactions don't reveal information about the transaction payload, such as the asset or value transacted.
- **Code Privacy:** Transactions don't reveal program logic.

Watch Zac, CEO of Aztec, describe our approach to building a privacy preserving smart contract blockchain.

### Private-public Composability

Highlighting how Aztec enables the composition of public and private functions to build applications with privacy for users, data, and code, you can watch Mike, Aztec PM, talk about it at Devcon here.

### **Aztec Development: Credibility, Decentralization, and Community**

- **Open Development:** Aztec is developed as a credibly neutral, decentralized network with contributions from the community and the company. The contributors to Aztec uphold many of the values of the Ethereum community: public development, a rigorous commitment to open source, and the goal of building a permissionless, censorship-resistant system.
- **Noir:** Introducing Noir as a domain-specific programming language for writing zero-knowledge circuits in Aztec. You can find more information and resources for learning about Noir smart contracts on [this page](../dev_docs/contracts/main.md).

## Cryptography

To support Aztec's rollup, our cryptography team is building [Honk](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/barretenberg/tree/master/cpp/src/barretenberg/honk), a cutting edge proving system that makes Aztec possible, under the Apache 2.0 License.
